# Output Folder

Calculated Simulation Data will be output in this folder. Each Simulation produces three types of files:

1. **Configuration.json:** This file stores a snapshot of the parameters and settings from the frontend that serve as input for calculations. Using the import option in the frontend settings can be loaded.
2. **Population.json:** This file stores a list of generated agents and their preferences. The population can be imported into the frontend for achieving comparable results.
3. **SimulationResult.json:** This file contains information on calculated KPIs and statistics. Furthermore, information on agent properties and movement is included. The file can be imported into the frontend for visualisation.
